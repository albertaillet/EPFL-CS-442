    "The circular Hough Transform can be used to detect circles in edge images. It is very\n",

    "more to take into account: circle radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we are given a pair of an original gray-scale image ```I[y, x]``` and a corresponding\n",
    "edge image `edge_I[y, x]`, of size $H \\times W$, such that $0 ≤ y < H$ and $0 ≤ x < W$. Every\n",
    "pixel of the edge image has logical value equal to 255 if the corresponding pixel of\n",
    "the original image belongs to an edge, and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "<p></p>\n",
    "If the radius of the circle to be found is fixed, then the parameter space is reduced to\n",
    "2-d. Each point $(y, x)$ on the original circle (in the image space) defines a circle centered\n",

    "<p></p>\n",
    "An accumulator matrix is used to find the intersection point in the parameter space. For a fixed radius, the accumulator array is a 2-D matrix, whose\n",
